Goals -- these should be believable. And set and describe your 
direction. So at any time you should be able to tell how far off you 
are. And if you're heading towards them on a direct and efficient 
route;

Operations -- captures how well you sell, produce and deliver your New 
and Existing Business. Operations should provide you profit, and then 
cash for the further development of the company and to reward 
shareholders. So, not only should you have an eagle eye on 
profitability (and trends in it) but on how your Asset use may be eating
available Cash. Realistically you must expect Existing Business to 
decline so you need to keep topping up with New Business to meet your 
Goals;Investment -- drives the company's New Business forward. For 
Sustainable Growth this should be funded out of Cash flow. If you can't
invest, you're unlikely to grow. The critical question is how much do 
you need to invest to meet your Goals?

to invest to meet your Goals

New Business -- this is the future of the business and without which you 
can't be sustainable. For many CEOs this is the most challenging 
because it involves getting a handle on the unknown. And involves 
behaviour and thought patterns different from rolling out product. The 
critical questions are -- what works, and how much will it cost? Or how 
do you maximise your return on investment

Corporate Support -- as you can see this sits in the middle of 
everything. This is the cockpit and control panels for the company. 
CEOs should feel in control and able (with their Board's guidance) to 
steer the company and to harmonise its activities -- especially 
Operations and Development.
